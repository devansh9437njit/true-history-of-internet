            A search engine is a software system that is designed to carry out web searches (Internet searches), which
            means to search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web
            search query. The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search
            engine results pages (SERPs) The information may be a mix of links to web pages, images, videos,
            infographics, articles, research papers, and other types of files. Some search engines also mine data
            available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories, which are maintained only by human
            editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler.
            Internet content that is not capable of being searched by a web search engine is generally described as the
            deep web.

            You can think of search engine optimization as unpaid search marketing – SEM’s free cousin. Essentially, SEO
            is a collection of diverse practices with a single common goal: improving your performance in the organic
            (non-advertisement) search results. To put it even more simply, strong SEO gets your website on page one.
            And if you’re not on page one, what’s the point?

            Once again, it all starts with a search query and a keyword. Similar to SEM, businesses that practice SEO
            focus on keywords relevant to them and try to rank as highly as possible. For example, WordStream aims (and
            succeeds!) to be the number one organic result for the search query “PPC software.” What does it take to get
            that top spot?
