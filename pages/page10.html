            More than 70 percent of internet users in the world’s larger economies go online via laptops and desktops
            for at least some of their connected activities.

            Social media use continues to grow too, with global users reaching 4.20 billion in January 2021.

            That’s equal to more than 53 percent of all the people on Earth.

            The number of social media users has increased by more than 13 percent over the past 12 months.

            More than 490 million new users have joined social media since January 2020, equating to growth of more than
            1.3 million new users every day.

            Roughly 9 in 10 of the world’s internet users already use social media each month, and six social media
            platforms now claim to have more than 1 billion monthly active users (check out our dedicated social media
            page for loads more social media stats).

            Meanwhile, two-thirds of the world has a mobile phone, with smartphones accounting for more than
            three-quarters of all the mobile handsets in use today.
