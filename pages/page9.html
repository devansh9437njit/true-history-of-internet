            The Internet’s history goes back some decades by now – email has been around since the 1960s, file sharing
            since at least the 1970s, and TCP/IP was standardized in 1982. But it was the creation of the world wide web
            in 1989 that revolutionized our history of communication. The inventor of the world wide web was the English
            scientist Tim Berners-Lee who created a system to share information through a network of computers. At the
            time he was working for the European physics laboratory CERN in the Swiss Alps.

            Here I want to look at the global expansion of the Internet since then.

            This chart shows the share and number of people that are using the Internet, which in these statistics
            refers to all those who have used the Internet in the last 3 months.1

            The chart starts in 1990, still one year before Berners-Lee released the first web browser and before the
            very first website was online (the site of CERN, which is still online). At that time very few computers
            around the world were connected to a network; estimates for 1990 suggest that only half of a percent of the
            world population were online.
