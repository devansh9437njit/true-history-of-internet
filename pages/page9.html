            The Internet’s history goes back some decades by now – email has been around since the 1960s, file sharing
            since at least the 1970s, and TCP/IP was standardized in 1982. But it was the creation of the world wide web
            in 1989 that revolutionized our history of communication. The inventor of the world wide web was the English
            scientist Tim Berners-Lee who created a system to share information through a network of computers. At the
            time he was working for the European physics laboratory CERN in the Swiss Alps.

            Here I want to look at the global expansion of the Internet since then.

            This chart shows the share and number of people that are using the Internet, which in these statistics
            refers to all those who have used the Internet in the last 3 months.1

            The chart starts in 1990, still one year before Berners-Lee released the first web browser and before the
            very first website was online (the site of CERN, which is still online). At that time very few computers
            around the world were connected to a network; estimates for 1990 suggest that only half of a percent of the
            world population were online.

            As the chart shows, this started to change in the 1990s, at least in some parts of the world: By the year
            2000 almost half of the population in the US was accessing information through the internet. But across most
            of the world the internet had not yet had much influence – 93% in the East Asia and Pacific region and 99%
            in South Asia and in Sub-Saharan Africa were still offline in 2000. At the time of the Dot-com-crash less
            than 7% of the world was online.

            15 years later, in 2016, three-quarters (76%) of people in the US were online and during these years
            countries from many parts of the world caught up: in Malaysia 79% used the internet; in Spain and Singapore
            81%; in France 86%; in South Korea and Japan 93%; in Denmark and Norway 97%; and Iceland tops the ranking
            with 98% of the population online.2

            At the other end of the spectrum, there are still countries where almost nothing has changed since 1990. In
            the very poorest countries – including Eritrea, Somalia, Guinea-Bissau, the Central African Republic, Niger,
            and Madagascar – fewer than 5% are online. And at the very bottom is North Korea, where the country’s
            oppressive regime restricts the access to the walled-off North Korean intranet Kwangmyong and access to the
            global internet is only granted to a very small elite.
