            Invention of the Internet
        </h1>

        <p>
            As you might expect for a technology so expansive and ever-changing, it is impossible to credit the
            invention of
            the internet to a single person. The internet was the work of dozens of pioneering scientists, programmers
            and
            engineers who each developed new features and technologies that eventually merged to become the “information
            superhighway” we know today.

            Long before the technology existed to actually build the internet, many scientists had already anticipated
            the
            existence of worldwide networks of information. Nikola Tesla toyed with the idea of a “world wireless
            system” in
            the early 1900s, and visionary thinkers like Paul Otlet and Vannevar Bush conceived of mechanized,
            searchable
            storage systems of books and media in the 1930s and 1940s.

            Still, the first practical schematics for the internet would not arrive until the early 1960s, when MIT’s J.C.R.
        Licklider popularized the idea of an “Intergalactic Network” of computers. Shortly thereafter, computer
        scientists developed the concept of “packet switching,” a method for effectively transmitting electronic data
        that would later become one of the major building blocks of the internet.

        The first workable prototype of the Internet came in the late 1960s with the creation of ARPANET, or the
        Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Originally funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, ARPANET used
        packet switching to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network.

        On October 29, 1969, ARPAnet delivered its first message: a “node-to-node” communication from one computer to
        another. (The first computer was located in a research lab at UCLA and the second was at Stanford; each one was
        the size of a small house.) The message—“LOGIN”—was short and simple, but it crashed the fledgling ARPA network
        anyway: The Stanford computer only received the note’s first two letters.
