            Coding a site for Netscape browsers was a dream come true for a lot of designers. With each subsequent
            release, the whole web medium drew into more complete focus. With each step, web designers could add new
            layers of interactivity and visual polish. True, these websites often would appear broken in other browsers.
            But by the middle of 1995, Netscape had jumped to an 80% share of the market. It might seem short-sighted
            now, but at the time, coding for Netscape was the only way to go.

            And it showed. By the time Netscape Navigator version 2 was released, the company had actually managed to
            accrue some revenue. Jim Clark, however, was not one to rest on his laurels. He began pushing his board to
            take the company public.

            It was a bit of an unprecedented move. Netscape had only been a company for a year, and they had only
            recently began to see real revenue come in. But Netscape did have a few things going for them. For one, they
            had a kind of cult like following. The press lauded their efforts, and their users evangelized their
            software. And at the center of it all was Marc Andreessen, who had been propelled to virtual rock star
            status.

            So Netscape went public. For a company of Netscape’s size, their IPO went incredibly well. It exceeded all
            expectations, and stocks soared throughout the first day. Clark, for his part, made over $600 million that
            day. Andreessen got to the cover of Time, and began calling for the dawn of a new age when the PC operating
            system would live entirely on the web, and specifically with Netscape.

            And that’s when Netscape got their first real competition from the goliath they knew would eventually come
            around: Microsoft.

            A few months before the IPO, Microsoft engineers paid a visit to Netscape offices. According to Microsoft,
            their intention was to get a lay of the land as they planned the future of Microsoft and the web.

            You see, Microsoft had largely ignored the web (and the Internet at large) for some time. Bill Gates failed
            to recognize the importance of this new network early on, so the company fell back on their core competency:
            personal computing. That means, if you used the Windows operating system (like 90% of PC users), you would
            have to go purchase a browser separately.

            Microsoft’s enterprise customers, however, began to ask for this kind of support. And some employees began
            experimenting with setting up web servers and a central information hub, which would later transform into
            the Microsoft Network. Then, Marc Andreessen began talking up Netscape not just as a browser, but as a new,
            cross-platform operating system. He went as far as saying that in the future, Netscape would reduce
            Microsoft to a set of “poorly debugged device drivers.”
