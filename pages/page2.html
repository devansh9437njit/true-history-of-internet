            The technology continued to grow in the 1970s after scientists Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed
            Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, a communications model that set standards
            for how data could be transmitted between multiple networks.

            ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the “network of
            networks” that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990,
            when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. While it’s often confused with the
            internet itself, the web is actually just the most common means of accessing data online in the form of
            websites and hyperlinks.

            The web helped popularize the internet among the public, and served as a crucial step in developing the vast
            trove of information that most of us now access on a daily basis.
