            The dotcom bubble grew out of a combination of the presence of speculative or fad-based investing, the
            abundance of venture capital funding for startups and the failure of dotcoms to turn a profit. Investors
            poured money into internet startups during the 1990s in the hope that those companies would one day become
            profitable, and many investors and venture capitalists abandoned a cautious approach for fear of not being
            able to cash in on the growing use of the internet.

            With capital markets throwing money at the sector, start-ups were in a race to get big fast. Companies
            without any proprietary technology abandoned fiscal responsibility, and spent a fortune on marketing, to
            establish brands that would differentiate themselves from the competition. Some start-ups spent as much as
            90% of their budget on advertising.
