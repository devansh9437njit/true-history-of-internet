            The Dot Com Bubble
        </h1>

        <p>
            The dotcom bubble, also known as the internet bubble, was a rapid rise in U.S. technology stock equity
            valuations fueled by investments in internet-based companies during the bull market in the late 1990s.
            During the dotcom bubble, the value of equity markets grew exponentially, with the technology-dominated
            Nasdaq index rising from under 1,000 to more than 5,000 between the years 1995 and 2000. In 2001 and through
            2002 the bubble burst, with equities entering a bear market.

            The crash that followed saw the Nasdaq index, which had risen five-fold between 1995 and 2000, tumble from a
            peak of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, to 1,139.90 on Oct 4, 2002, a 76.81% fall. By the end of 2001, most
            dotcom stocks had gone bust. Even the share prices of blue-chip technology stocks like Cisco, Intel and
            Oracle lost more than 80% of their value. It would take 15 years for the Nasdaq to regain its dotcom peak,
            which it did on April 23, 2015.
