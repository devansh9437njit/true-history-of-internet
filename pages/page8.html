            Well, think about Google’s business model. It attracts consumers by offering an immense, instantaneously
            accessible index of information. Then, it sells SERP real estate to advertisers. Google’s attraction of
            consumers rests on its capacity to produce high-quality, relevant search results. If the results aren’t
            helpful, consumers abandon Google, and Google loses ad money.

            This is informative. In order to rank highly in the organic results, you need to be a quality resource. To
            be more precise, you need to be an authoritative resource. In the eyes of Google, you attain Domain
            Authority every time a reputable website links to your website. The more links you earn from external
            resources, the more authoritative your website becomes, and the better you perform in organic search
            results.

            You need to be a relevant resource, too. Relevance to a particular search query comes from optimizing your
            content for a keyword within that query. If you want your blog post to organically rank for the keyword
            “lawn care basics,” you better make sure those words appear in the title, the URL, the headings, the
            subheadings, the body copy, the image names, and the alt texts. This ubiquity, as long as it’s not overdone
            (keyword stuffing), signals to Google that your page is relevant to the search query. If you’re
            authoritative, your blog will rank well.
